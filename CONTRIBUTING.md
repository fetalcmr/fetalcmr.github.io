# Contributing

Content can be added on the main page (`index.md`) or as a separate page. 

[Pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) using the [GitHub branch-based workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) are the best way to propose content additions and changes:

1. Create a branch from `main` with a succinct but descriptive name
2. Make and commit changes.
3. Open a pull request.
4. Discuss and review with the repo/page maintainers.
5. Once ready, one of the maintainers will merge your branch into `main` and the content will be included on the website.

Alternatively, contact the maintainers of this repo.
